<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>This homework involved implementing functionality to the existing to allow for rendering and applying textures to triangles that comprise most
  images. We went from rasterizing single-color triangles to implementing antialiasing, transforms, texture mapping, and minmaps. Throughout this grueling
  task that took me way too long to finish, I definitely feel like I have gained more insight into the topics covered in lecture and learned
  how they are implemented.
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>

<p>Since the program only works when the triangle is winding in counterclockwise
  order, it is necessary to swap two points if it is clockwise. Another important thing was establish 
  the bounding box of the triangle before trying to rasterize. A point-in-triangle test was used
  to check whether the pixel should be filled.
</p>

  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/hexagon.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Stars surrounded by hexagons.</figcaption>

    </tr>
  </table>
</div>


<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>

<p>Implementing supersampling involved splitting a pixel into samples that
  correspond to the sampling rate. For this part, I felt like it was necessary to create
  a new function (which I did not need to at all, I could have just changed fill_pixel) to
  iterate through samples in the sample buffer. Before resolving to the frame buffer, an average
  color was created by adding the color of each sample of each pixel and averaging it
  by the sampling rate.
</p>
<p>This took me like two days because I sort of had to understand all of the moving pieces 
  of the program. I could have done it much faster if I didn't freak out from the enormous lines of
  code that were seemingly too complicated (it was much better than I thought). 
</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Transforms</h3>

<p>This was fairly easy to implement. For each transformation, a corresponding matrix 
  is created for matrix multiplication, which would alter the x and y coordinates accordingly.
</p>

<div align="middle">
  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>
      <td>

        <figcaption align="middle">A pose asserting dominance.</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<h2 align="middle">Section II: Sampling</h2>
<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>

<p>For implementation, it was more or less an extenstion of part 2. The formula shown 
  in class needed to converted to matrix form. And it was equally as important to remember that 
  matrix multiplication is not commutative. 
</p>
<p>I have actually seen the circle that was used for the test before but never understood the significance
  of it. Learning about Barycentric coordinates, it really showed me how important it is when 
  it comes to computer graphics. The ability to transfer seamlessly between coordinate spaces is really 
  cool and useful. Things like color gradient is only possible every point is defined in relation to the 
three points.</p>

<div align="middle">
  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/gradient.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">A wheel of colors seamlessly blended (almost).</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>

</div>

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>

<p>A texture is also made up of pixels so it only makes sense that texturizing a mesh involves mapping texels
   to pixels. But most of the times, it is not possible to do a one-to-one mapping. Therefore, we could 
  try and approximate what some pixels would look like using sampling. Implementation involved converting pixel 
  coordinates (x, y) to texture coordinates (u, v) and using one of two sampling methods: nearest or bilinear.
</p>
<p>
  Nearest is quite simple; it takes the nearest texel and applies it. Bilinear involves taking 
  surrounding texels and finding the weighted average of them. This gives a smoother appearance 
  to images since the rate of change in color between pixels will be less. Picking one really depends on 
  what you prefer for your project. 
</p>

<div align="middle">
  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/nearest.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">1 sample per pixel.</figcaption>
      </td>
      <td>
        <img src="images/bilinear.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">4 samples per pixel.</figcaption>
      </td>
  </table>
</div>


<h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texel mapping</h3>

<p>Ideally, we would want for texels to map one-to-one to pixels. However, zooming into an image 
  gives us too many pixels for a texel. Zoooming out gives us the opposite: too many texel for a 
  pixel. To achieve our ideals, or close, we have to keep different copies of a texture at different 
  resolutions, with level 0 being the highest resolution possible, and dynamically chose which to use. A 
  tradeoff is that it consumes more memory since multiple copies of the same texture need to be stored. 
</p>
<p>This was something that completely went against what I initially thought. I had always thought that 
  the higher resolution an image is, the better, and that was how games operate when it came to graphics. I did 
  realize that there was a whole hierachy behind the scenes. But after learning more, it does make sense. At higher distances, 
  aliasing is introduced since a pixel could potentially be completely different from an adjacent pixel since each 
  pixel have to chose from a range of texels.
